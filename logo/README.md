# The WarriorJS logo

The WarriorJS logo was designed with the origins of the WarriorJS project in mind—<br>
[WarriorJS](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs) is played from the Terminal, so doing something mixing ASCII art and high-color contrast made a lot of sense.

These are the original WarriorJS logos. Don't use any other logo to represent WarriorJS.

## Flavors

The logo comes in two flavors, each in a dark and light version.

The horizontal lockup should be your first choice whenever possible.<br>
When the space is limited, there is a small version a.k.a. *The WarriorJS Sword*.

## Spacing

To ensure the logo stands on its own, please leave at least one *x*'s worth of space around it.

## Colors

The WarriorJS color palette is mostly neutral, but should not be considered *“shades of grey”* (much less *"fifty shades of grey"*).

Dark color: `#1b2936`

Light color: `#f8f8f8`
