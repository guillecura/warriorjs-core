# Ability

Abilities are plain JavaScript objects which have the following members:

* `type` (*String*): The type of the ability. It can be either `'action'` or `'sense'`.
* `description` (*String*): The description of the ability.
* `perform` (*Function*): A function that defines how the ability operates.

As a tower maker, you will be writing functions that return abilities.
