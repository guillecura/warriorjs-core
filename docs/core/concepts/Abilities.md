# Abilities

Abilities are skills possessed by the units.

Although unit types have a fixed set of skills, abilities can also be assigned to specific units in a level. This is usually the case with your warrior. When you first start, your warrior will probably have only a few abilities which will grow with each level.

There are two kinds of abilities: actions and senses.

### Actions

An action is a skill that affects the game in some way. *Only one action can be performed per turn*.

### Senses

A sense is a skill used to gather information about a unit or space on the floor. You can perform senses as often as you want per turn to gather information about your surroundings and to aid you in choosing the proper action.
