# Scoring

Your objective is to not only reach the stairs, but to get the highest score you can.

There are many ways you can earn points on a level:

* defeat an enemy to add his max health to your score

* pass the level within the bonus time to earn the amount of bonus time remaining

* clear the level before climbing the stairs to receive a 20% overall bonus

In addition to that, some abilities can award points when used.
