# Playing

Once you are done editing the Player class, you are ready to start playing the level.

The play happens through a series of turns. On each one, your `playTurn` method is called along with the other unit's.

You cannot change your code in the middle of a level. You must take into account everything that may happen on that level and give your warrior the proper instructions from the start.

Losing all of your health will cause you to fail the level. You are not punished by this, you simply need to go back to the Player class, improve your code, and try again.

Reaching the stairs, on the other hand, will take your warrior to the next level.
