# ![WarriorJS Core](https://cdn.rawgit.com/warriorjs/warriorjs-core/master/warriorjs-logo.svg)

WarriorJS is a game that will put your JavaScript skills to the test.

You play as a warrior climbing a tall tower to `[insert something motivating here]` at the top level. On each floor, you must write JavaScript to instruct the warrior to battle enemies, rescue captives or do whatever it is necessary to reach the stairs alive.

WarriorJS Core extracts the mechanics of the original game, allowing you to build and share your own WarriorJS universes (with custom units, abilities and levels).

### Inspiration

The original [warriorjs](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs) is a ported version of [ruby-warrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior), developed with the intention of teaching JavaScript (and the *at-the-time* new ES2015 features) in a different way.

### Installation
